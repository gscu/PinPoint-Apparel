			<!-- ***FOR THE CLICK ON PIC ATTRIBUTE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS SHOULD BE PLACE IN ACCORDANCE TO EXECUTIVE MEMBERS*** Thanks-->
			<!--Pinpoint isn’t any ordinary Toronto clothing brand. Our mission is to promote local businesses through the articles of clothing. As a company run by students, we are able to quickly identify our target market, young individuals who are socially-conscious and want more than apparel; an adventure. One of the greatest advantages of being a student-run company is that we are part of the target market and have connections to our market through school and other extracurricular activities.
